# screening_task
File .py is the final result of my work. I also uploaded .ipynb notebook that I used for prototyping most of my work, but it's just pieces of code that might not make any sense to anyone, including me, in a few days :> I'm very happy to participate in the whole process and already learned a lot during this task. Waiting to hear from you in the near future!
