# screening_task
File .py is final result of my work. I also uploaded .ipynb notebook, that I used for prototyping most of my work, 
but it's just pieces of code that might not make any sense to anyone, including me in a few days :>
I'm very happy to participate in the whole prcess and alredy learned a lot during this task. 
Waiting to hear from you in the near future!
